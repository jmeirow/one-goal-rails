				Being able to lead and communicate effectively are core elements of life goals... including New Year's resolutions.  This program: "ONE Goal to a Better Life" will help you chart a path to your goal by using opportunities in Toastmasters. 
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
					<strong>Q:</strong> How? 
				<br/>
				<strong>A:</strong> You will apply Toastmasters' research-proven techniques to achieving goals. The simple process is: set a goal, commit to it, work on it, track it,  and get support from others. A section of this website will show you how to use Toastmaster objectives (link c) to reach your goal.
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				<strong>Q:</strong> Really?
				<br/>
				<strong>A:</strong> Think about it - you have used these principles to move along in Toastmasters - whether you have achieved your CC or CL or are working toward your DTM.
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				<strong>Q:</strong> What type of life goals does this encompass?
				<br/>
				<strong>A:</strong> Just about anything. Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to run a marathon? Do you want to have a better relationship - with your spouse, your parents, your children or your friends? Do you want to get a promotion at work? Do you want to run for public office? We - the D28 Toastmasters community - can help you achieve it.
				Or, you can apply the "ONE goal" strictly to your Toastmaster education objective. With that, you'll get extra support and encouragement in finishing your manuals and completing leadership projects. 
			</p>


			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				<strong>Q:</strong> How often do I need to go online?
				</br>
				<strong>A:</strong> Work out your own pace, but weekly check-ins are advised. Each month, you should be able to show progress toward your goal. 
			</p>

			<h4>"SMART" Goals </h4>
			 

				 

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>


				SMART: goals should be: <em><strong>S</strong></em>pecific, <em><strong>M</strong></em>easurable, <em><strong>A</strong></em>chievable, 
						<em><strong>R</strong></em>elevant, and <em><strong>T</strong></em>ime-bound.
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>

				Other suggested goals:

			</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Become more social. </li>
				<li>Build my network of business associates (try going to advanced clubs)</li>
				<li>Become a professional speaker.</li>
				<li>Get a promotion at work.</li>
				<li>Start my own business.</li>
				<li>Become president of my homeowners' association.</li>
				<li>Build regular exercise into my lifestyle.</li>
				<li>Take charge of my finances. </li>
				</ul>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				For some of the larger goals, research the topic and write and deliver a speech about it. Develop the topic into table topic questions. Make the subject of your goal the "word of the day." Make it part of the opening message at your home club. Visit a neighboring club and deliver a speech about your goal. Your goal can be broken down into different aspects. For example, a diet involves a nutritional game plan, exercise, elimination of bad habits (don't eat ice cream every night while watching TV) and keeping a food journal. Each of these aspects of dieting is speech worthy, and can be quite humorous. 
				Envision your goal. When you are thinking of your ONE goal, create a specific vision of where you would like to be with it in five months. Some examples follow:
			</p>


				<ul>
				<li>tying the shoelaces of your running shoes prior to a spring or summer marathon </li>
				<li>setting up your presentation in the board room of your company </li>
				<li>taking a sip of water before giving a keynote speech to 500 members attending a convention </li>
				<li>addressing members of the homeowners' association, explaining why you should be the group's next president </li>
				<li>making reservations for a second honeymoon, thanks to better communication in your relationship</li>
				<li>accepting your DTM pin at the spring conference</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				...you get the picture.
			</p>
